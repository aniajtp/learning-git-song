      <p>I looked out across <br>
        The river today <br>
        I saw a city in the fog and an old church tower <br>
        Where the seagulls play <br>
        I saw the sad shire horses walking home <br>
        In the sodium lig.ht <br>
        I saw two priests on the ferry<br>
        October geese on a cold winter's night <br>
        <br>
        And all this time, the river flowed <br>
        Endlessly to the sea <br>
        <br><br>
        Two priests came round our house tonight <br>
        One young, one old, to offer prayers for the dying <br>
        To serve the final rite <br>
        One to learn, one to teach <br>
        Which was the cold wind blows <br>
        Fussing and flapping in priestly black <br>
        Like a murder of crows <br>
        <br>
        And all this time, the river flowed <br>
        Endlessly to the sea <br>
        If I had my way I'd take a boat from the river <br>
        And I'd bury the old man, <br>
        I'd bury him at sea <br>
        <br><br>
        Blessed are the poor, for they shall inherit the earth <br>
        Better to be poor than a fat man in the eye of a needle <br>
        And as these words were spoken I swore I hear <br>
        The old man laughing <br>
        What goo used up world and how could it be <br>
        Worth having' <br>
        <br>
        And all this time the river flowed <br>
        Endlessly like a silent tear <br>
        And all this time the river flowed <br>
        Father, if Jesus exists, <br>
        Then how come he never lived here
